				Paul was born in Berkeley, CA but he grew up on the Jersey Shore where he attended Monmouth Regional
				High School and worked summers at the beach. He maintains that the donuts at
				<a href="https://www.deliciousorchardsnj.com">Delicious Orchards</a> in
				Colts Neck, NJ are the world's best.</p>
			<p>
				Paul has climbed several 14,000' peaks, including Mt. Rainier, Mt. Shasta, and Mt. Whitney.
				He enjoys backpacking, skiing, and road and mountain biking.
				Paul has broken 5 bones, causing friends and family to debate whether he is too adventurous,
				unlucky, or clumsy.</p>
