				Paul has been teaching Computer Science at the
				<a href="usfca.edu">University of San Francisco</a> since 2022.
				He teaches several introductory courses that cover:
				<ul>
					<li>Java programming</li>
					<li>Object oriented programming, inheritance, and polymorphism,</li>
					<li>Advanced data structures such as linked lists, rings and trees,</li>
					<li>Algorithm complexity,</li>
					<li>Recursion,</li>
					<li>Basic graphics.</li>
				</ul></p>
			<p>
				A highlight of Paul's courses are the projects in which students write software to
				play multiplayer games against other students' programs.
				Past games have included Blackjack, Acey-Deucey, Poker, and Liar's Dice.
				At the end of each project, students compete for prizes in a Game Night to see who's programs
				have the best strategy (or most luck).</p>

		This image is used in Paul's classes as an example of bad design.
		The orange bottle contains spray-on sunscreen, and to be environmentally conscious,
		the designer used propane as a propellant rather than fluorocarbons.
		Thousands of teenagers discovered a fun use for spray bottles of propane,
		and the product was recalled in less than one week.</p>
